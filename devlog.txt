# Developer Update History

- Developed the Tic_Tac_Toe class in the game_loop_and_state.py file, which contains the 
remove_from_the_flattened_vector_of_positions(...) method, an internal method which
takes care of removing elements from an internal state array, 
the looping_game_logic(...) method, in which all other methods are called, and 
the determine_final_game_state(...), which is yet to be implemented.
- Created the printing_utility.py file, which houses the 
array_to_terminal_output(...) method, which is used to display the state of the
board to the terminal (Work_In_Progress)

- Implemented the determine_final_game_state(...) method, which determines the
outcome of the game
- Created a CPU that flattens out all the positions of the array, and puts its
character at the first available position on that array
- Finished up the array_to_terminal_output(...) method, so that it faithfully
displays each turn of TicTacToe.

# Version History
v1.0 - Minimum Viable Project
- Allows users to play a game of TicTacToe by running game_loop_and_state.py

going from top to bottom, that hasn't been filled.
