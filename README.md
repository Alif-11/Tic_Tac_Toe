# Project Description
This is my minimum viable project (my v1.0) for a game of Tic Tac Toe.

# Version History
v1.0 - The minimum viable project update
- Created an over_terminal game of Tic Tac Toe, where users have to input the positions they want to deposit characters at.
- It features a basic CPU that picks the first available position, starting from left to right on the top row, then descending a row if the current row is fully taken up.
